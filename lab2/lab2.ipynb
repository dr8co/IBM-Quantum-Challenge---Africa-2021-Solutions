    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The world of finance is a complicated one to model and predict. The financial markets, in particular, are influenced by so many external factors and contain multiple different investors with different objectives. This means that traditional modelling techniques, like multiple linear regression, often struggle when trying to explain investors' behaviours or perform certain tasks in finance, such as predicting the price of a stock. Due to these complexities, we need more sophisticated models and numerous techniques have been proposed to produce such robust models for financial instruments like stocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Africa, the dynamics of the financial markets are arguably even more complicated. In this notebook, we discuss what types of financial instruments we can encounter in the South African market, particularly those that are liquid (meaning they are frequently traded and accurately valued). Illiqid instruments are also prevalent in Africa and are more difficult to evaluate and price, since they are not often traded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we introduce a common pricing technique for a particular instrument called an option. This technique rests on Monte Carlo sampling which we show can achieve a quadratic speed up in pricing the option by replacing the classical Monte Carlo sampling approach with a quantum algorithm that leverages quantum effects to compute things faster.

    "\n",
    "A financial instrument is any asset that can be traded between various parties. For example, shares of a company are equity instruments, and debt, cash and even contracts can be considered as financial instruments. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we can divide financial instruments into several categories, such as cash instruments, asset or debt-based instruments and derivative instruments. In this challenge, we will focus on the last category, namely, derivatives. These instruments get their name from the fact that their price is *derived* based on the price of a separate underlying quantity. In particular, we will consider derivatives called European options.

    "### Option contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "Options are financial derivatives that are defined explicitly by contracts. These contracts give the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific underlying asset at an agreed-upon price sometime in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Options that give the buyer the right to *buy* the underlying asset are called **call options** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Options that give the buyer the right to *sell* the underlying asset are called **put options**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the price to buy or sell the asset at, is agreed upon in the contract and called the **strike price**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's assume that the share price of a company called ABC is currently trading at $S_0 =$ 50 ZAR. You believe that in 1 months time, the share price will double to 100 ZAR. You can either buy the share now for 50 ZAR, or you could buy a 1-month call option for a much cheaper price of 5 ZAR. If the price of the ABC share does indeed double in 1 months time, then you can exercise your option right to buy the ABC share at the agreed up strike price (which will be lower than the actual share price). This may sound a little tricky, so let's make it concrete by going through an example with various scenarios we can encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the current price of ABC is $S_0 =$ 50 ZAR. A 1-month call option with a strike price of $K =$ 80 ZAR is available to purchase for $P_{\\mathrm{call}} =$ 5 ZAR. Let's consider the scenarios of buying an ABC share today or the call option.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Today:\n",

    "\n",
    "Scenario 2: Buying a 1-month call option on ABC\n",
    "Investment = $P_{\\mathrm{call}} =$ 5 ZAR\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In 1-months time:\n",
    "Since option contracts are valid for a pre-determined period of time, their value at the expiration date is called the *payoff* that you will recieve. Technically, the price of an ABC share could be trading at any value greater than or equal to 0 ZAR. Let's imagine that the price after 1-month $S_t$ can be 40 ZAR, 60 ZAR or 100 ZAR and look at the payoffs for each scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $S_t =$ 40 ZAR \\\n",
    "    Scenario 1: Since you own the share of ABC and purchased it at 50 ZAR, you will lose 10 ZAR. I.e. the payoff will be a loss of -10 ZAR. \\\n",
    "    Scenario 2: The strike price is higher than the actual share price. Thus, you would not execute the option to buy ABC at $K =$ 80 ZAR when you can purchase the share on the market at 40 ZAR. You will lose out on the price you paid for the call option and so the payoff will be a loss of -5 ZAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S_t =$ 60 ZAR \\\n",
    "Scenario 1: The payoff will be the profit you made from buying the share at 50 ZAR and it's current price. I.e., payoff = 60 - 50 = 10 ZAR. \\\n",
    "Scenario 2: The strike price is still higher than the share price. Thus, you would not execute the option and lose 5 ZAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S_t =$ 100 ZAR \\\n",
    "Scenario 1: payoff = 100 - 50 = 50 ZAR \\\n",
    "Scenario 2: Here, the strike price is lower than the market price so it makes sense to execute the option. By doing so, you can buy the share at the strike price of 80 ZAR and the profit is therefore = 100 - 80 = 20 ZAR. However, remember that you also paid a premium for the option so the total payoff is 100 - 80 - 5 = 15 ZAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, you might be wondering why buy the option at all? And it kind of seems like betting? What's important to keep in mind is the initial investment you have to put up in order to buy the actual ABC share vs buying the call option. Buying the share requires a much higher investment and you run the risk of losing a lot more money if the share price drops below the price you initially paid for it. Whereas with the option, if the share price drops below the strike price, you can just let the option expire and lose a maximum of 5 ZAR (the price you paid for the option). There are also other reasons to purchase options, such as hedging against risk or offsetting other trades. In general, you can read more about these strategies here: https://www.investopedia.com/trading/options-strategies/"

    "Now, how on earth do we begin to price these option contracts? Previously, we said the price of a 1-month call option linked to the ABC share price was 5 ZAR. But is that price fair? And how would be go about determining the fair price of these options in general? \n",
    "\n",
    "If we think about what should affect the fair price of an option, it boils down to understanding the what the price of the underlying asset it is linked to will be in the future. Due to the random (also called stochastic) nature of most of the parameters that go into pricing the underlying assets that options are defined on, calculating the fair price can be a difficult task, and whilst analytical models exist for the basic types of options, the simplifying assumptions required for these models often limit their applicability. Thus, numerical methods that estimate the fair price have to be employed for option pricing, with Monte Carlo being one of the most popular. "

At a high level, imagine you have a function (or equation) that is described by multiple variables and you're interested in solving that function, but it is analytically difficult to do so because the function depends on lots of complicated variables. \n",

    "A Monte Carlo approach simply samples random values for the parameters of your function from an underlying distribution and computes the function multiple times, each time using a different set of randomly sampled values. In doing so, we can obtain an expected value for the function we are trying to evaluate by taking an average over all the computed values of the function. This allows us to estimate function values without having to analytically solve them directly."

    "The goal of option pricing is to estimate the option's payoff at the expiration date. In other words, how much profit can you expect to make from the option? If the underlying asset's price is expected to go up a lot, then you can expect to make more money if you can buy the underlying asset at a cheap price when it is worth a lot.

We therefore do not discount the expected payoff for simplicity and can ignore step 4.\n",
