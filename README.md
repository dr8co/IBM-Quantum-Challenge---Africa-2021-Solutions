# IBM-Quantum-Challenge---Africa-2021-Solutions
These are my solutions to the IBM Quantum Challenge - Africa 2021.

The challenge consists of three labs covering three different applications of quantum computing.
Each lab contains multiple exercises, taking you through the process of setting up your problem model, configuring your quantum algorithm, and solving for your problem by executing your quantum algorithm.
Each lab is presented as a Jupyter notebook which is hosted on the IBM Quantum Lab.
